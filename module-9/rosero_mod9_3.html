		<h2>The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost</h2>
		</div>
		<p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as <span id="line-1">____________</span>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
		<p>Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was <span id="line-2">______________________</span>;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,</p>
		<p>And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way <span id="line-3">_______________</span>,
I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
		<p>I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
I took <span id="line-4">_____________________</span> by,
And that has made all the difference.</p>
